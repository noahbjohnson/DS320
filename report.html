          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/225755/americans-news-bias-name-neutral-source.aspx">According to Gallup polls</a>, 45% of Americans see “a great deal of bias” in the current news media. For reference, that number was 25% in 1989. With numbers like it’s easy to see that the concept of “fake news” is relevant to many Americans, but how can we measure bias in the media?</p>

          <p>Sites like mediabiasfactcheck.com try to examine the bias of various news outlets and report on their findings. They use a variety of methods including identifying biased wording, story choices, and factuality. There are a few other sites with different methodologies, but the reality of social media echo-chambers means that their impact is negligible.</p>

          <p>In this report I will examine articles from two biased news sites. theblaze.com is a conservative news platform founded by Glenn Beck. On the liberal side, thinkprogress.org is a progressive political news blog run by the Center for American Progress. Both of these sites are near the extreme end of their respective political biases, and they both often have their content go viral on social media. This makes them a perfect couple for analyzing the issue of media bias.</p>

          <h3>Data Collection</h3>
          <a href="downloads.html">View the Notebooks</a>

          <h5 style="margin-top:1rem">The Blaze</h5>
          <p>To collect data from theblaze.com articles, I took advantage of Wordpress’s predictable archival URL structure. A list of all the articles published in a day is available at theblaze.com/news/[year]/[month]/[day]. I was able to iterate through the dates to collate a list of article URLs to scrape. I then iterated over this list and used python’s BeautifulSoup to extract my data from the html.</p>

          <h5>Think Progress</h5>
          <p>Data collection for thinkprogress.org was much easier than the Blaze. I located the site’s RSS feed URL, and fed it into Python feedParser. Using the Wayback Machine from archive.org, I accessed historical RSS feed copies. The availability of the RSS feed allowed me to directly extract variables without needing to parse HTML.</p>

          <h5>Variables</h5>
          <p>At the end of the process, I had the following variables for both sites:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Article Title</li>
            <li>Article Body</li>
            <li>Article Author</li>
            <li>Article Published Date</li>
            <li>Article URL</li>
            <li>Article Site</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>


      <div class="row" style="margin-top:5rem" id="cleaning">

          <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
          <a href="downloads.html">View the Notebook</a>

          <h5 style="margin-top:1rem">Encoding</h5>
          <p>After collecting the data from both sites, I needed to clean the text to ensure maximum performance from sentiment analysis and topic modeling. The first step was to remove or convert the plethora of unicode characters that were in the article bodies. I used unicodedata.normalize() to extract ASCII text from the article bodies.</p>

          <h5>Data Types</h5>
          <p>Next, I had to ensure that the datatypes were correctly interpreted in the data-frame, as they were mostly represented by strings in the original database. I converted author and site to categorical variables, and article published timestamp to date-time.</p>

          <h5>Metadata</h5>
          <p>Finally, I constructed two metadata fields: Body Length in Characters, and Title Length in Characters. It was important to have these fields because many of the APIs for sentiment and topic modeling charge by 100 characters. It was also important to be able to estimate the time to compute a model locally if I decided to do so.</p>

          <h3>Text Processing</h3>
          <a href="downloads.html">View the Notebooks</a>
          <p>Most of the data that I scraped is next to useless on its own. I needed to add more information to the dataset in order to make any visualizations or conclusions.</p>
          <h5 style="margin-top:1rem">Basic Sentiment with Vader</h5>
          <p>I have very little experience in text-processing machine learning. Therefore, I decided that the best place to start would be an easy-to-use pre-trained model. It seems that the Vader model from the Natural Language Toolkit is widely used and accepted. I used the Text-Blob package to create a nice wrapper around the model, and was able to add the following columns:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Title Polarity</li>
            <li>Title Subjectivity</li>
            <li>Body Polarity</li>
            <li>Body Subjectivity</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>indico.io Models</h5>
          <p>I needed a better sentiment model in my dataset, but I didn’t want to spend countless hours training custom models on my local machine. After some deliberation, I decided that I would use a pre-trained sentiment analysis API. I’ve used Google Cloud ML and Amazon Comprehend before, but their pricing structure is geared towards live applications. Ultimately I decided to try the apis on indicio.io. They have great reviews, and good academic discounts. (Luckily for me they were offering free API usage as recompense for previous outages.) Using their python wrapper, I added the following columns:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Title Sentiment</li>
            <li>Body Sentiment</li>
            <li>HQ (combined) Sentiment</li>
            <li>Title Political Lean</li>
            <li>Body Political Lean</li>
            <li>Title Emotion</li>
            <li>Body Emotion</li>
            <li>People Referenced</li>
            <li>Places Referenced</li>
            <li>Organizations Referenced</li>
            <li>Keywords</li>
            <li>Text Tags</li>

          <a href="downloads.html">View the Notebook</a>
          <p>With all of the grunt work out of the way, I began my analysis. The following are the questions I asked, the visualizations I used, and the conclusions I reached.</p>

          <h5 style="margin-top:2rem">Is News Getting More Negative?</h5>
          <p>It seems that the news these days has been getting more and more negative. With the wide variety of available news sources, those with the most shocking stories often profit. I set out to test this hypothesis: Is news getting more negative? Using matplotlib, I created some visualizations to help identify trends.</p>

          <h5>Do the Sentiments of Articles about Trump Reflect His Approval Rating?</h5>
          <p>President Donald Trump is on of the hottests topics of discussion in news, biased news included. In order to understand how the content of biased news articles interacts with his approval rating, will test the following:<br>Do the sentiments of articles talking about Trump reflect his approval rating in any way, and how is the sentiment of the two sites different on this issue?<br>I got approval rating information from the American Presidency Project <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/presidential-job-approval">here.</a> Using this data and matplotlib, I created some visualizations to help identify trends.</p>

At some points in the plot, the variables appear to increase similarly. However, there are just as many times that the lines move in an inverse manner.<br>Maybe this is a result of both liberal and conservative articles sharing a variable. I'll plot the sites individually to compare.</caption>

          <h5>Clickbait!? Do Article's Titles Express More Emotion Than Their Bodies?</h5>
          <p>Clickbait is when titles or summaries of articles are designed to entice users to read. Headlines are often exaggerated, sensationalized, and sometimes downright false.<br>Like many other entertainment sources, politically biased news sites often employ clickbait tactics to drive readership.<br>By exploring the relationship between sentiment and emotion in articles' titles and bodies with plots, I hope to identify quantifiable characteristics of politically biased clickbait.</p>

          <p>Both sites in my dataset are pretty extreme, so it will be interesting to see the results of these graphs.<br>I have no prediction as to how sentiment and political lean will interact. Ideally, the following plots will provide enough evidence to support findings.<br>I will first examine the emotion and sentiment of the two sites, and then explore the effects of political lean.</p>

          <p>Both Think Progress and The Blaze have very right-skewed histograms for sentiment. Due to the severity of the deviation of the skew from a normal distribution, it's safe to say that the sites both have mostly negative content.<br>However, the two sites' sentiment histograms are not identical. The Blaze's histogram is basically flat at a .75 density at .35 and above. Think Progress almost gets down to .5 density at .5 sentiment, but then it gets back up past 1 density at 1.0 sentiment, forming what looks like a bimodal distribution.<br>The net result is a small difference in measures of central tendency, but a large qualitative difference.</p>
